# MovieCatalog
Test project for interview

Here is the list of used technologies: 
  - androidx.paging for loading movies by pages;
  - android.arch.navigation for navigation between screens;
  - retrofit2 for loading data from server;
  - picasso for showing images;
  - room for working with database;
  - moxy to save state of view over configuration changes;
  - MVP pattern to separate ui from business logic;
  
also I have added an adaptive icon and custom windowBackground for splash screen to provide cute animation when user starts the application
