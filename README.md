# MovieCatalog
Test project for interview

I used 
  androidx.paging for loading movies by pages
  android.arch.navigation for navigation between screens
  retrofit2 for loading data from server
  picasso for showing images
  room for working with database
  moxy to save state of view over configuration changes
  MVP pattern to separate ui from bissness logic
  
also I have added adaptive icon and custom windowBackground for splash screen to provide pretty animation when the user opens application
